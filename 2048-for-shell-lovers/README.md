# 2048-for-shell-lovers
2048 game for shell lovers. If you love only that black screen (terminal) with no UI at all and you spend all your life in front of that screen only, then you are at the right place, just play 2048 on bash (completely on bash, no other feature involved and have fun
Just run the game by typing ./play (be sure to make play file executable)
That's all.

Made this game in my first year when I learned C-Programming, out of nowhere I found it back after one year and still I enjoy it a lot. :-)
Special thanks to Akshay Jaggi Sir who help me to add some more cool features to my game.

Only for linux users.
